I am a PhD researcher in the Materials Science and Engineering department at UIUC since Fall 2017. I am working with [Prof. Pinshane Huang](https://huanglab.matse.illinois.edu/) on exploring the structure-property relationships in 2D materials through aberration-corrected STEM and advanced image processing techniques such as deep learning.

Prior to my PhD study, I was a research assistant in the group of [Prof. Cheng-Yen Wen](http://www.mse.ntu.edu.tw/index.php?option=com_zoo&task=item&item_id=101&Itemid=896&lang=en) at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering in [National Taiwan University (NTU)](http://www.mse.ntu.edu.tw/index.php?lang=en). For my Master's thesis [I designed and built an ultra-high vacuum CVD system](https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZK7RBcdkT8) so that I can [synthesized graphene on nickel silicide substrate without interface oxidation](http://www.mse.ntu.edu.tw/~cwen/Chia-Hao_Lee.html). I've also been employed as a TEM teaching assistant for new user training and assisted operation by the MSE department throughout my Master's study in NTU.
